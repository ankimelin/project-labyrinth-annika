# Project description
Text based labyrinth adventure built in React and Redux.

# The problem
Started analyzing the game requirements and what the backend API provided using Postman. Setup the Redux store and initial state, and the component structure. Thereafter it was a step by step implementation of one logic part at a time: creating username, game started, loading and finally the API fetches built inside thunks that could fill the game with content. Styling was done inspired by the traditional text based game adventure games.

Next step if revisiting: implement user input for user name, and using reusable components for all buttons.
